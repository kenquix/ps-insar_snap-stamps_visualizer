# ps-insar_visualizer

A simple web app to visualize the Persistent Scatterers (PS) identified using the [SNAP - StAMPS workflow](https://forum.step.esa.int/t/snap-stamps-workflow-documentation/13985). You can **visualize your own data** by uploading the Matlab file *(e.g., 'ps_plot_ts_v-do.mat')*. 

This is inspired by the [StAMPS visualizer based on R](https://forum.step.esa.int/t/stamps-visualizer-snap-stamps-workflow/9613). If you have suggestions on how to improve this, let me know.
